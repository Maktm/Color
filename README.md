## Color

Windows colored output library for C++. The library is written using C++11 and uses
a `^1Hello` syntax where `^1` represents the user wanted to change to the color
assigned to the number 1. Color to number mappings can be dynamically modified
as required so you can have `^1` change the output to red, green, blue etc.

## Usage
The library is written in C++11 so all you need is a C++11-compatible library and
a Windows computer. Simply include the header file and use any of the color
changing functions.
